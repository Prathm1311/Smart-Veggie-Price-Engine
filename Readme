# VegPrice – Smart Vegetable Price Prediction System

VegPrice is a backend-focused project where a Java Spring Boot application integrates with a Python FastAPI ML service to predict vegetable prices based on season and demand.
The goal of this project is to understand real-world backend + ML integration, REST API communication, and service-based architecture.

🚀 Tech Stack
Java – Spring Boot (Main backend & business logic)
Python – FastAPI (ML model service)
Machine Learning – Scikit-learn
Database – MongoDB
Communication – REST APIs (JSON)

🧠 Features
Dynamic vegetable price prediction
Season & demand-based pricing
Java ↔ Python service integration
Clean DTO-based API communication
Beginner-friendly microservice approach

📸 Demo & Results
Below are screenshots showing the working flow of the application, including data sent to the Python ML service and the predicted final price.
